# Quadratic Equation Solver

## Project Description

This project is a Python-based quadratic equation solver that calculates the roots of any quadratic equation of the form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0). It provides a simple and efficient way to find the real and complex roots using the quadratic formula.

## Features

- **Handles All Cases:** Solves quadratic equations with real and complex roots using the help of a built-in module in Python called "cmath"/
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A "CustomTkinter" graphical interface to make solving equations easy.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Displays the roots immediately after the coefficients are entered in a messagebox.
- **Detailed Output:** Provides clear and detailed output, including both roots and discriminant analysis.

## How to Use

1. **Input the Coefficients:**
   - The first input box is for the A coefficient, B is second and C is third

2. **Solve the Equation:**
   - The program will calculate the answer using the "cmath" library to support complex numbers like i (sqrt(-1))

3. **View the Results:**
   - The roots are displayed immediately after clicking "Calculate"

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the solver or adding new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. One thing I would like to add is some placeholder text on the input fields to make it more clear which field is for which variable.
